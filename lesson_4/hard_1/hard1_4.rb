The designers of the vehicle management system now want to make an adjustment for
how the range of vehicles is calculated. For the seaborne vehicles, due to prevailing
ocean currents, they want to add an additional 10km of range even if the vehicle
is out of fuel.

Alter the code related to vehicles so that the range for autos and motorcycles is
still calculated as before, but for catamarans and motorboats, the range method
will return an additional 10km.
