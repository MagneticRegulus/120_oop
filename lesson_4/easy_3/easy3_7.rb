# What is used in this class but doesn't add any value?

class Light
  attr_accessor :brightness, :color

  def initialize(brightness, color)
    @brightness = brightness
    @color = color
  end

  def self.information
    return "I want to turn on the light with a brightness level of super high and a color of green"
  end

end

# Is it the information method? Or the explicit return? The latter ! Ding ding ding
# also the attr_accessor is not really used but are potentially valuable.
